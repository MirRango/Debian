Tables: Tables in nftables refer to a particular protocol family. The table types are
ip, ip6, inet, arp, bridge, and netdev.
Chains: Chains in nftables roughly equate to tables in iptables. For example, in
nftables, you could have filter, route, or NAT chains.


sudo apt install nftables
To show version :>>   nft -V
To list of installed tables:>>  sudo nft list tables
cat /etc/nftables.conf 
Examples of nft configfile:>>  cd /usr/share/doc/nftables/examples
sudo cp /usr/share/doc/nftables/examples/workstation.nft   /etc/nftables.conf

Allowing ssh,http and dns.
sudo vi /etc/nftables.conf  ===
===================
	tcp dport { 22, 80, 53 } ct state new accept
             udp dport {53} ct state new accept           
====================================
Load the configuration file and view the results:
sudo systemctl start nftables
sudo systemctl reload nftables
To view our new rule:>>  sudo nft list ruleset

Now, when you need to peruse the /var/log/kern.log file to see how many dropped
packets you've had, just search for the Dropped packet text string.
Now, let's say that we want to block certain IP addresses from reaching the Secure Shell
port of this machine. Do so this, we can edit the file, placing a drop rule above the rule that
opens port 22 . The relevant section of the file would look like this:
tcp dport 22 ip saddr { 192.168.0.7, 192.168.0.10 } log prefix "Blocked SSH
packets: " drop
tcp dport { 22, 53 } ct state new accept

Now to view log file:>>  cat /var/log/kern.log
